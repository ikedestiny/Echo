## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to build a minimum viable product (MVP) for a dating app. The goal is to create a simple, functional app with core features, then iterate based on user feedback.

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform mobile apps) or React.js (for web).
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
- Database: Firebase (for beginners) or MongoDB/PostgreSQL.
- Hosting: Heroku, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Planning & Design (Week 1-2)

1. Define Core Features:

   - User profiles (photos, bio, basic info).
   - Swipe-to-match functionality.
   - Real-time messaging for matches.
   - Basic search filters (age, location, gender).

2. Create Wireframes:

   - Use Figma or Adobe XD to design the appâ€™s UI.
   - Focus on:
     - Home screen (swipe interface).
     - Profile page.
     - Chat screen.

3. Set Up Project Repo:
   - Create a GitHub repository for your project.
   - Initialize the project with your chosen tech stack.

---

### Milestone 2: Backend Development (Week 3-4)

1. Set Up the Server:

   - Create a Node.js server with Express.js.
   - Set up routes for:
     - User authentication (sign-up/login).
     - Fetching user profiles.
     - Handling matches and messages.

2. Database Setup:

   - Use Firebase for real-time database and authentication (easiest for beginners).
   - Alternatively, set up MongoDB or PostgreSQL for user data, matches, and messages.

3. API Development:
   - Create APIs for:
     - User registration and login.
     - Fetching profiles for the swipe interface.
     - Storing matches and messages.

---

### Milestone 3: Frontend Development (Week 5-6)

1. Set Up Frontend:

   - Use React Native for mobile apps or React.js for web apps.
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., react-navigation for mobile).

2. Build Screens:

   - Home Screen: Swipe interface with profiles.
   - Profile Screen: Display user details and photos.
   - Chat Screen: Simple messaging interface for matched users.

3. Integrate APIs:
   - Connect the frontend to your backend APIs.
   - Fetch and display user profiles, handle swipes, and enable messaging.

---

### Milestone 4: Testing & Debugging (Week 7-8)

1. Test Core Features:

   - Test user registration, profile creation, swiping, matching, and messaging.
   - Use tools like Postman to test backend APIs.

2. Fix Bugs:

   - Address any issues with the swipe functionality, messaging, or API integration.

3. Gather Feedback:
   - Share the app with a small group of testers (friends or family).
   - Collect feedback on usability and performance.

---

### Milestone 5: Launch MVP (Week 9-10)

1. Deploy the App:

   - Host the backend on Heroku, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.
   - Publish the mobile app to the App Store or Google Play (if using React Native).

2. Monitor Performance:
   - Use tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel to track user activity.
   - Monitor server performance and fix any issues.

---

### Milestone 6: Iterate & Add Features (Week 11-12+)

1. Gather User Feedback:

   - Ask users what they like and what could be improved.
   - Prioritize features based on feedback.

2. Add Unique Features:

   - Start with one unique feature (e.g., icebreaker questions, voice messages).
   - Gradually add more features like gamification, video profiles, or AI-based matching.

3. Scale the App:

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to build a minimum viable product (MVP) for a dating app. The goal is to create a simple, functional app with core features, then iterate based on user feedback.

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform mobile apps) or React.js (for web).
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
- Database: Firebase (for beginners) or MongoDB/PostgreSQL.
- Hosting: Heroku, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.

---

## Features

### Core Features

These are the essential features every dating app needs:

1. User Profiles:
   - Photos, bio, age, gender, location.
2. Swipe-to-Match:
   - Swipe left (no) or right (yes) on profiles.
3. Matching:
   - Notify users when they match with someone.
4. Messaging:
   - Real-time chat for matched users.
5. Search Filters:
   - Filter matches by age, location, and gender.

---

### Unique Features

These features will make your app stand out:

1. Icebreaker Questions:
   - Fun prompts to help users start conversations (e.g., "What’s your favorite travel destination?").
2. Voice Messages:
   - Allow users to send short voice clips.
3. Daily Match Limit:
   - Limit swipes per day to encourage thoughtful matching.
4. Profile Prompts:
   - Add creative prompts to profiles (e.g., "Two truths and a lie").
5. Video Profiles:
   - Let users upload short video introductions.
6. Interest Tags:
   - Add hashtags to profiles for easier matching (e.g., #Foodie, #TravelLover).

---

### Advanced Features

These can be added after launching the MVP:

1. AI-Powered Matchmaking:
   - Use AI to suggest better matches based on user behavior.
2. Gamification:
   - Add badges, levels, or challenges to engage users.
3. Virtual Dating:
   - Video calls or virtual activities (e.g., watching movies together).
4. Safety Features:
   - Profile verification, block/report users, and date check-ins.
5. Social Integration:
   - Link Instagram or Spotify to profiles.
6. Push Notifications:
   - Notify users about new matches, messages, or app updates.

1. Define Core Features:
   - User profiles, swipe-to-match, messaging, and search filters.
2. Create Wireframes:
   - Design the app’s UI using Figma or Adobe XD.
3. Set Up Project Repo:
   - Initialize the project with your chosen tech stack.

---

### Milestone 2: Backend Development (Week 3-4)

1. Set Up the Server:
   - Create a Node.js server with Express.js.
2. Database Setup:
   - Use Firebase or MongoDB/PostgreSQL for user data, matches, and messages.
3. API Development:
   - Create APIs for user registration, profile fetching, and messaging.

---

### Milestone 3: Frontend Development (Week 5-6)

---

### Milestone 4: Testing & Debugging (Week 7-8)

1. Test Core Features:
   - Test user registration, swiping, matching, and messaging.
2. Fix Bugs:
   - Address any issues with functionality or performance.
3. Gather Feedback:
   - Share the app with testers and collect feedback.

---

### Milestone 5: Launch MVP (Week 9-10)

1. Deploy the App:

- Host the backend on Heroku, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.
  - Publish the mobile app to the App Store or Google Play.

2. Monitor Performance:
   - Use analytics tools to track user activity and server performance.

---

### Milestone 6: Iterate & Add Features (Week 11-12+)

1. Gather User Feedback:
